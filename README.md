## About Me

I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating innovative solutions and contributing to open source projects. Here's a bit more about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [OCM](https://ocm.software/) at @SAP. The Open Component Model (OCM) is an open standard that enables teams to describe software artifacts and their lifecycle metadata in a consistent, technology-agnostic way. Itâ€™s built to support secure, reliable delivery and deployment of softwareâ€”across cloud, on-prem, hybrid, and even air-gapped environments. By decoupling and streamlining lifecycle processes like compliance checks, security scans, and deployments, OCM helps teams collaborate more effectively and build trust into every step of the software supply chain.
- I'm also maintaining [TopoLVM](https://github.com/topolvm/topolvm/) in my free time, and I used to work in OpenShift at [LVMS](https://github.com/openshift/lvm-operator), a Local Sorage Meta Operator powered by lvm2.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for someone to help me push [lvm2go, my new binding API for lvm2 to Go](https://github.com/jakobmoellerdev/lvm2go), as well as [topovgm, a volume group node manager for accompanying TopoLVM](https://github.com/jakobmoellerdev/topovgm)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about SBOM, SBOD, lvm2, k8s, k9s
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: contact@jakob-moeller.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: My white hair is my trademark!
